# Car Price Prediction using Multiple Regression
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file that demonstrates how to predict car prices using multiple regression. The car prices data is sourced from the cars.xls file, and the regression is performed using statsmodels and sklearn.preprocessing libraries.

# Getting Started
To run the notebook, you will need to install the following libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
statsmodels
sklearn

After installing the necessary libraries, you can open the Jupyter Notebook file (car_price_prediction.ipynb) and run the code cells to reproduce the analysis.

# Data
The cars.xls file contains information about different car models, including their prices, mileage, horsepower, and other features. The goal of the analysis is to predict car prices based on these features using multiple regression.

# Approach
The analysis is performed using the following steps:

Load the data from the cars.xls file and perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
Prepare the data for regression by encoding categorical variables and scaling the data.
Perform multiple regression using the statsmodels library and interpret the results.
Evaluate the performance of the regression model using different metrics, such as R-squared and mean squared error (MSE).
Use the regression model to make predictions on new data.

# Results
The analysis shows that it is possible to predict car prices using multiple regression with reasonable accuracy. The regression model has an R-squared value of 0.86, indicating that it can explain 86% of the variance in the data. The mean squared error (MSE) of the model is 2.03, indicating that it has a low prediction error.

# Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates how to perform multiple regression analysis on car prices data using Python and statsmodels library. It shows that it is possible to predict car prices with reasonable accuracy using multiple regression. However, further improvements can be made by using other machine learning techniques or including additional variables in the analysis.
